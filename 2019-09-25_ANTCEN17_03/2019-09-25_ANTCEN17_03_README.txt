Using the (thought to be) recovered hkl about ANTCEN, and starting
with Mercury's export of the ANTCEN17 .cif as res; however, the
lattice constants a, b, c, beta were altered to be now about P2(1)/c
as the the earlier P2(1)/n model.  The old "LATT 1" instruction was
retained as exported by Mercury.

The .hkl file contains h, k, ell; intensity Fobs, sigma (Fobs) -- as
provided by Table 5 of the original publication about ANTCEN17.  The
numerical data of the two last entries (two decimals) printed in the
paper were divided by 10 to obtain the initially data put into this
table / file.

The .res file is an export of the CCDC .cif file about ANTCEN17 as
provided by CCDC Mercury (free version 3.9).
