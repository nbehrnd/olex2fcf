Again attempting to re-refine or resolve from scratch CCDC's CSD model
about anthracene ANTCEN17 (pure, no co-crystal, no disorder; complete
set of C and H atoms).  Contrasting to 2019-09-25_ANTCEN17_03, though,
the information of table 5 in Marciniak2002.pdf is harvested completely
-- now including both Fobs and Fcalc, similar to a .fcf file instead of
an .hkl file.

Background: Horst Puschmann mentions Olex2 were capable to access hkl-
information from the structure file .fcf. [1]  On paper, it seems a
feasable transformation, especially because the earlier question has
a .fcf as test file (s286p.fcf).

The two pages of interest in the publication Marciniak2002.pdf were
extracted (inkscape), deposit as individual .pdf (ISO A4, in landscape
orientation) to [2] yiedling two .txt files.  Footer and empty lines of
the two files joined were removed and an intermediate .csv about the
complete table was exported.  The table was reorganized to contain one
stream of h, k, ell; Fobs, Fcalc, sigma only.  The last three entries
were divided by 10 (ten) to yield the original values provided by ShelX,
and formatted to contain two decimals.

Following the pattern of s286p.fcf, a new structure factor file

Marciniak2002_fcf_header_addition.fcf

was created, including information about unit cell dimension and space
group symmetry, for example.

This .fcf and the .res file (exported by Mercurt 3.9 while reading the
corresponding CCDC .cif file) were copy-pasted into the sub-folder

start_files_remaned

while the other files were stashed into the sub-folder

preparations

The start files, renamed for consistency, are backed-up in sub-folder

start_files_remaned

+ The attempt to use a .res and a .fcf renamed as .hkl (approach /with/
  a header in the .fcf) for Olex2 (1.3alpha release, September 10, 2019)
  did not work.  Olex2 tries in vain to generate a new .hkl file, and
  probably a new .ins file refering to the (potential) reindexation of
  information, too.

+ The attempt to use a .res and a .fcf file renamed as .hkl /lacking/ a
  header information in the then .hkl file allows to access the data.
  However, even a tiny refinement (5LS with ShelX) renders the already
  flattened ADP negative; only the hydrogen atoms remain in Mercury's
  display a sphere; however, with different diamater [sic!].

+ Olex2's new option to suggest a space group symmetry more suitable,
  than the currently dialed one, fails on this set of data.  Assuming
  "a start in P1 still may be brought to higher symmetry [e.g.,PLATON's
  Lepage]" equally fails; no successcul structure solution with either
  1) ShelXS' direct methods, 2) ShelXT, or 3) Olex2 charge flipping.

Deposit to the attention the author of the reply how to bring .fcf-based
information to Olex2, Horst Puschmann.
